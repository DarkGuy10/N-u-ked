# N-u-ked
A `self bot` for server raiding written in `Python3`. <br>

**I am not responsible for whatever you use the code for!!!**

## Warning!
Self bots like this break Discord's TOS and hence your account may get **banned**. <br>

## Requirements
You must have the following preinstalled
```
python3
pip 
discord.py
```
discord.py can be installed from command line using:
```
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

## How to use?
1. Clone this repositiory (or download and extract the .zip)
```
git https://github.com/DarkGuy10/N-u-ked
```
2. Get your Discord user token. Don't know how? [Click here](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token)

3. Open `config.json` file in the `N-u-ked` folder with a text editor and replace the `your_token` with the user token you obtained in `Step 2`. (Paste your token **inside the ""**)

4. Open a command prompt, `cd` into the `N-u-ked` folder and run the `N-u-ked.py`
```
python N-u-ked.py
```

5. Wait till you get a `Client connected!` message and a list of servers you are in.

6. Select the server you want to raid. The code will detect the privileges you have in that server and then execute the **most damaging raid.**

###### Now watch the server die...

## Raiding methods 
`mass channel delete`<br>
`mass channel create`<br>
`mass banning`<br>
`mass kicking`<br>
`mass role create`<br>
`mass nickname change`<br>

## Why did I make this?
Because why not! <br>
Also, this is **not** related to Divine's raid in Otogakure in any way.
